# MultiRegionsDeformable
Multi Region Image Segmentation with a Single Level Set Function. This repository contains a python implementation of the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6995952) based mostly on numpy. 

## Installation
You need:
- standard python libraires numpy, scikit-image 
- opencv (for initialization purposes)
- scikit-fmm (you can install it via the command `pip install scikit-fmm`). 

To reproduce the plots :
- matplotlib
- seaborn

In this repository, we used the nt-toolbox library, developped by Gabriel Peyr√©, and transposed to Python language by Theo Bertrand (see : [url](https://github.com/TheoBertrand-Dauphine/MVA_NT_geodesic_methods))
